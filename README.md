## About
The website I developed is a recipe sharing site where users can upload their favourite recipes, make any changes, or take them off the site. They will also be able to see other recipes shared by other users.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories
    1. Users just wanting to look for recipes would use the directory on the home page
    2. Users who want to add a recipe would navigate to the add recipe page and fill out the form presented
    3. Users will also be able to edit recipes on the edit page, similar to the home page the saved recipes will be diplayed and there will be an option to edit
    4. Similar to the edit page the delete page will have the recipes displayed but with the option to delete

### Design

#### Colour Scheme
I didn't want anything too sharp on the site so I chose pastel colours as I though they would be easier on the eye. I used https://www.schemecolor.com/color/pastel and picked different colours I thought worked from different colour themes.

#### Typography
The font used on the site is Archivo Narrow with sans-serif as a backup. The font was taken from Google fonts (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Archivo+Narrow?query=Archivo+Narrow). I thought that the font was clear and easy to read and would be perfect for a recipe webiste.

#### Imagery
Imagery used was just simple images taken from stock photo website (https://unsplash.com/). The purpose is for mainly aesthetic for the carousel to illustrate the options that the users have on the site.

#### Wireframes
Wireframes were created using Balsamiq, https://github.com/Stephen-Caldwell/Milestone-Project-3/blob/main/static/assets/wireframe
